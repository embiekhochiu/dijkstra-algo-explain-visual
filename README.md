### Overview of the project
Our objective is to delve into the fundamentals of the algorithm, elucidating the advancements of Dijkstra's algorithm in contrast to other prevalent path-finding algorithms.

After careful consideration, we dhave opted to transform our traditional report into a more comprehensive paper. The paper of the project can be found in the repository.

We use **Google Colab** for this project, so the notebook for each part can be found by the given link. 

### Our project have four main parts:
* Initialize the path-finding problem [Initialize the problem](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v-msP3cjDrUYQZCFuw0Rmf1ddp-LyNbC?usp=sharing)
* Other approachs to tackle the problem [Brute Force and Bellman Ford Algorithm](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bneU4oj7qQWKO-faKtpd_VYL9PmibubZ?usp=sharing)
* Explain Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm [Explain Dijkstra](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w9pD1SdcHkPcmewvHHJCZDBZOKPrfzAF?usp=sharing)
